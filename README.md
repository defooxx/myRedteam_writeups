# ðŸŒ’ Red Team Writeups

Just here cause I am curious about everything as hell. 

This space is my archive: part journal,part battleground, where I document what Iâ€™m learning, breaking, and rebuilding in cybersecurity.  
Iâ€™m drawn to what hides in plain sight. I liketo break rules and see whats forbidden. 

Inside: TryHackMe labs, offensive tools, writeups, and scars Iâ€™ve earned while teaching myself how to think like an attacker.

Every command I run is a step closer to mastering this craft.  
This is only the beginning.
